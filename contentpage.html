      			<h3>A Mystery of Man</h3>

<pre><p>A fleeting shadow, a whisper of light,
Born from the dark, a spark in the night.
In search of meaning, he roams and strives,
A riddle wrapped in the web of lives.

What drives his heart, so deep, so wild?
The thoughts of a man, the mind of a child.
A dance of doubt, a search for truth,
The quest for answers from youth to youth.

In silence he ponders, in chaos he stands,
Grasping at time with trembling hands.
The stars, the earth, the oceans wide,
He seeks the source, yet cannot decide.

A creature of wonder, of grief, and glee,
Bound by the question: What is he to be?
A heart that dreams, a soul that yearns,
In endless cycles, it twists and turns.

A mystery etched in every face,
A puzzle written in endless space.
Man’s journey is a road unknown,
In the depths of himself, he stands alone.

Yet still, he moves, he strives, he learns,
In his eyes, a fire still burns.
For the mystery is not to solve,
But to live with the questions that never evolve.

      			<h3>Life is a Mystery</h3>

<pre><p>Life is a mystery, a winding thread,
A path unknown, where shadows are led.
It dances between the light and dark,
A fleeting spark in the endless arc.

We search for answers, seek the truth,
Through endless years, from youth to youth.
What lies beyond the veil we see?
What whispers softly, "Come, follow me?"

In moments of joy, in times of pain,
We wonder if we’ll find our way again.
Each choice we make, each step we take,
Is a chance to heal or a chance to break.

A puzzle with pieces scattered wide,
The heart’s desires, the mind’s divide.
We grasp at moments, but they slip away,
Like sand through fingers, day by day.

Yet still we live, we love, we try,
We reach for stars in a restless sky.
For life is a mystery, wrapped in time,
A rhythm unknown, a silent rhyme.

So let the questions linger and stay,
For in the mystery, we find our way.
Life, a riddle, ever unfolding,
In its mystery, we keep beholding.

      			<h3>A Dream Within a Dream</h3>

<pre><p>Is all we see but fleeting mist,
A world we touch, a thought dismissed?
A dream that whispers through the night,
Fading with the morning light.

What if this life, with all its grace,
Is just a dream, a fragile place?
A moment grasped, then lost in time,
A fleeting thought, a silent rhyme.

We stand on shores, we sail through seas,
Bound by the wind, the gentle breeze,
But do we know where we are bound,
Or if the dream will end, unfound?

A hand we reach for slips away,
A voice that calls, now far astray.
Like sands that fall through outstretched fingers,
The essence of our being lingers.

Are we but echoes in the air,
Waking to find we’re not quite there?
A dream within a dream, we roam,
Seeking a place we can call home.

And as we fade, as all things do,
Is this the end, or just a view
Of what we never truly see—
A dream within a dream, set free?

      			<h3>The Vanishing Hour</h3>

<pre><p>At the stroke of midnight’s chime,
A figure moves, unseen in time.
The door is locked, the window sealed,
Yet something vanishes—unrevealed.

A faint perfume, a distant sigh,
A whispered name, a fleeting cry.
Where did they go, who left this trace?
The mystery lingers, leaving no face.

Clocks tick on, the hour fades,
But still the question softly invades:
Who was here, and where did they flee,
In the vanishing hour, lost to me?

Footsteps echo, soft and light,
Fading quickly into night.
A shadow shifts beneath the door,
But when I look, it’s there no more.

A candle flickers, then it dies,
The room is still, beneath dark skies.
No sign of who had walked these halls,
No hint of their voice or their calls.

A diary lies open, pages turned,
But the secrets inside are what I yearn.
Yet with each glance, the ink seems strange,
Words vanish too, just out of range.

The clock strikes once, the night is through,
But still the question lingers true:
Who was here, and why did they leave,
In the vanishing hour, we must believe?
