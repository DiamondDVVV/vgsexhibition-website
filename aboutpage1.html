      <td colspan="3"><p>Hello! My name is Rianna, and I’m currently an 8th-grade student. One of my greatest passions is reading books and novels. I’ve always felt that books are like windows to other worlds.They provide a perfect escape from everyday life. When I read, I get to experience new adventures, meet fascinating characters, and dive into imaginative realms that are only limited by the author’s creativity. I truly believe that literature has the power to transport you to places you never could have imagined on your own.</p></td>

          <td><h3>Why did I choose this topic ?</h3>
            <p> I chose this topic because mystery is my favorite genre, and what I love most about it is the suspense that builds with every new twist and turn. The thrill of not knowing what will happen next, and the way the tension grows as each clue is uncovered, is what makes mystery stories so captivating. There’s something unique about the excitement that comes from trying to solve a puzzle along with the characters, piecing together the story as new secrets are revealed.

          <td><h3>What are my interests ?</h3>
            <p> My interests revolve around two main passions: reading and solving mysterious problems. Reading allows me to dive into different worlds, especially those filled with suspense, intrigue, and complex puzzles. It's a way for me to escape reality while sharpening my imagination and problem-solving skills. I enjoy reading mystery novels because they challenge me to think critically and connect the dots between seemingly unrelated clues, much like solving a puzzle.

One of my biggest inspirations is the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes. I idolize him not only for his incredible intelligence but also for his methodical approach to solving mysteries. His ability to observe the smallest details, make connections others would miss, and use logic to unravel even the most complicated cases is something I deeply admire. Sherlock’s character has taught me the value of curiosity and patience, as well as the importance of looking beyond the obvious to uncover hidden truths. His sharp mind and relentless pursuit of answers motivate me to think more critically and to approach challenges with a sense of determination and focus, much like Holmes himself.</p></td>  

          <td><h3> Why I like mystery so much ?</h3>
            <p>The main reason I am drawn to mystery stories is because of the suspense they create and the way the detective uses their sharp observations and logical deductions to solve the case. The excitement of not knowing what will happen next keeps me hooked, as each new clue adds another layer to the puzzle. The tension builds with every twist and turn, and that sense of uncertainty is what makes the genre so captivating.</p></td>
