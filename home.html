        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I’ve always had a deep love for art. It feels like a way to express myself when words aren’t enough. 
            I enjoy experimenting with different styles and mediums, from sketching with pencils to painting with vibrant colors. 
            Art helps me relax and connect with my thoughts, and it’s a way for me to share my view of the world.</p>
        <p>For me, painting and crafting aren’t just about the final product. They are about enjoying the process
            and bringing creativity to my world.</p>
