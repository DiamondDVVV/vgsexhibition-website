               Music can be categorized into various types based on its style, instruments, and cultural roots. Classical music, known for orchestral compositions and symphonies, offers a refined and structured sound. Jazz, with its improvisation and complex rhythms, highlights emotional expression, while rock music, with electric guitars and energetic themes, is known for its rebellious spirit. Pop music, focused on catchy melodies and broad appeal, is loved worldwide, while hip-hop/rap emphasizes rhythm and lyrical delivery. Blues reflects emotional struggles, country music tells stories of love and life, and electronic dance music (EDM) is designed for dancing with synthesized beats. Reggae, rooted in Jamaican culture, promotes peace and social messages, while folk music preserves cultural traditions through simple melodies. Each genre offers a unique experience, shaping different moods and occasions. </i></th>
